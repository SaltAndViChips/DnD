a small town that is alive with travellers as the locals prepare for the Changing of Leaves. A festival that takes place every year, and it begins tomorrow. Many strange folk from all over have gathered here to celebrate. It’s early Autumn, and the town, much like the leaves of the nearby trees, has become covered in warm decorations of reds, oranges and yellows.
