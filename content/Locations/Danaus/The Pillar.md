A cozy tavern with an old and weathered dwarf working behind the counter. Known only as [[Cinder]] to those in town, due to his copper beard seeming to glow in the light. 

He works the bar in a jolly fashion, even though his hands are calloused, and his body perfectly kempt except the notable scar running from his brow down to his jaw, creating a gash in his otherwise perfectly kept beard 

The tavern stays barren during the day but at night, everyone in town packs tightly inside to have a traditional drink before going to sleep. On the house of course.
