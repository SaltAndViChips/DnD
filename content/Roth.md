The largest building in town, a stunning temple made of obsidian, seemingly pulling in the light around it. Yet it stands beautifully, and elegantly. Just past the archway, players will immediately be able to notice the intricate copper altar, adorned with carvings of a beautiful woman, with a skull for a head. 

  

The interior lit by the gashes along the roof, mimicking the legs of a butterfly with mosaics of monarchs filling in the gashes. Bathing the altar in Tinted Sunlight. Small amber lights flutter around the corners of the room seemingly shy of the sun, giving the dark architecture a warm feeling, and leaving the floors glowing like hot coals. At night these lights fill the room and even venture slightly outdoors, lining the entryway with flickering lights.

  

Behind the temple is a well kept garden. It is home to a variety of fruit trees, many of which mysteriously continue to bear fruit, even as their leaves change colors. The largest tree stands out among the rest, bearing Black Magnolias, with the husband and wife's names seemingly embedded into the trunk, yet clearly not carved.   
  
The owners of this building are a married couple, adorning soft robes matching the colors of the building, with small patterns similar to those seen on the altar.  
  
The wife Ezhui is a tall, muscular human, with tanned skin, and a deep orange eyes that seem to glow underneath the hood of her robe. Strapped to her back is a wooden paddle, framing the imagery of an abstract skull, the sides lined with shards of obsidian, many of the pieces fractured. Her hands covered in scars to the observant player. She’s a retired adventurer, who spent her life savings to purchase the glasswork done on their home. She comes from a different land, and has seen many things, but doesn’t wish to dwell, as she’s happy with her new life.  
  
The Husband Tizec is a scrawny, shy fellow, who’s short golden hair can sometimes be seen gleaming beneath his hood. Carrying a small hooked staff with lots of loose, handmade charms hanging from the tip, seemingly made by children, gifts from the local youth to the couple and their worship. He is a priest, and the town healer. 

  

They worship Itzpapalotl, the great Clawed Butterfly. The ruler of the lands of which they believe humans were created. They cherish their creation and generously help any who come to their temple seeking it, as much as their humble lives can afford.
