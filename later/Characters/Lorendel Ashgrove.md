Lorendel is the primary antagonist of the campaign.

The Phylactery of Lorendel is a collection of pocket dimensions roughly made up of areas of massive magical and fated significance that he has planeshifted. By feeding off the magical energy of an area his soul is tied to the material plane.
Lorendel has done this in the pursuit to modify [[Ambrosia]] to be consumable by mortals curing all disease. This is to cure his pet whale.
