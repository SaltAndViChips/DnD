Freya is an Ice Genosi, and the master Blacksmith of [[Lullin]].

Freya built the frosted roads, and forges many great master crafts for all future heroes.

Freya can create complex shapes of Nevermelt Ice, a substance hard as diamonds, nearly invisible, and easily molded by her. Her husband [[Theodore Rey I]] can fill empty molds of Nevermelt Ice with fire to add +2 Fire Damage and provide resistance to cold damage.

She is mostly quiet and prefers to stay in small groups, as her great abilities have led people to want things from her. She is very generous, and loves all she creates, most of all her children.

Freya is considered a Deity of the region, and goes by Rey to avoid recognition.
