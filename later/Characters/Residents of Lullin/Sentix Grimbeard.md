Sentix has a shiny white beard and wears a messy leather apron over a green cotton shirt and a pair of khaki pants.

Sentix is a happy-go-lucky merchant in the town of [[Lullin]].

Sentix deals in odds and trinkets, mostly having junk or joke magical items.

However, Sentix has stumbled onto some real magical items if the players can roll a luck check DC15.

Sentix is more than willing to bargain for anything interesting and doesn't care about gold or monetary value, he prefers the story behind an item over anything.
