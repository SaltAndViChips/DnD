Crimson is a red dragonborn with a long slender snout.
Commonly wears basic dark red hunters garb and hides in the shadow of the hood over his face.

Crimson wields "Queens Boon", a Bow made from Nevermelt ice, along with matching arrows that generate from his quiver. This was forged for him by his mother [[Freya (Rey)]] 

Crimson while being fairly old, is a snarky teenager. While deep down he is a good person, he has trouble sharing his emotions and loves to taunt and goad people.
