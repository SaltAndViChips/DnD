Lust is a Human male with incredibly dark, pristine skin.

Lust is an incredible singer and painter, his works often duplicated across the lands.
Counterfeits of his paintings fill castles and his songs are sung by minstrels in Taverns everywhere, but never with as much power as when sung by him.

Lust is motivated solely by pleasure of all kinds, and will never be satisfied.
Eating only the best foods, and associating with only the best people, Lust wanders from village to village, searching for his next pleasure.

	Abilities
Lust can cast a DC20 Charm spell on anyone currently observing his works within 100ft.
