Lot is a frail old Tortle, often found sleeping at the Frozenforge Tavern.

Lot wears many wonderous robes, being the sin of Sloth.

Unlike the other sins Lot is a mostly helpful guardian, providing the benefits of a long rest for any short rest taken where he is sleeping, along with giving that area the effect of Sanctuary. These benefits also apply to his [[Robes of Sloth]].
