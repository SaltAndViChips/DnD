Eternal hunger is a cursed inflicted by [[Gluttony]].

When holding a consumable, the character must make a DC10 Constitution saving throw to not immediately consume it, using a full action.

Attempting to give consumables to another character will require a DC10 Wisdom saving throw.

The character is immune to harmful effects caused by ingested foods such as Poisons or Ambrosia Sickness.

This can be cured by fasting for 24 hours.
